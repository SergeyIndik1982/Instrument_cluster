# Instrument_cluster
This project involves the implementation of an instrument cluster as the second DES (Distributed Embedded Systems) project in the SEA:ME curriculum.

## Overview
An instrument cluster, also known as a dashboard cluster or gauge cluster, is a critical component of a vehicle’s dashboard. It provides the driver with essential information about the vehicle’s status and performance through various gauges, indicators, and warning lights. Here, we implement an instrument cluster showing real-time speed data on a screen with GUI.

- [WaveShare 7.9inch DSI LCD](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.9inch_DSI_LCD)

### Software
- Main application: C++(Qt framework)
- Firmware(for Arduino): C
- Host OS(for development): Ubuntu 20.04
- Raspberry Pi: Rasbian Desktop 64bit
- IDE: Qt Creator, Arduino IDE
- Version control: Git

## Configuration
### Display - WaveShare 7.9inch DSI LCD
After we have written RaspberryPi OS (Debian Bookwarm, 64bit) to a sd card, we have added lines below to 'config.txt' at the root of the sd card file system. And ejected the sd card and boot up our Raspberry Pi, and we were able to see the display working as expected.

### SeeedStudio 2-CH CAN HAT for Raspberry Pi
[Followed instructions on here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/2-Channel-CAN-BUS-FD-Shield-for-Raspberry-Pi/)
To activate CAN protocol on Raspberry Pi, you need to run:
```
sudo ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 500000
```

### Auto start Instrument Cluster at booting
```
# /etc/xdg/autostart/InstrumentCluster.desktop
